This was a really fun exercise!

I ended up spending just about 2 hours I think. I took a few breaks in between commits. 

Considering the time constraint, I really wanted to make sure the aspects that I love about front end developing were present. UI and UX specifically and I think it shows. 

I ended up going with Angular and Angular Material.

Here is a screenshot:

Things you can do: 

 - Filter content
   - Can search home team by doing `@ Yankees`
   - Can search any team or keyword
 - Sort content by Away, Home, Date, and Series.
   - Date is sorted in ascending order by default
 - Pagination
 
Given more time I think I would've taken a different design approach, but I figure this works and is a little bit unique.

To run this application on your machine: 

  - Clone the repo
  - In your cmd: `cd post-season`
  - `npm install`
  - then `ng serve --open`

Should do the trick ðŸ˜Š
